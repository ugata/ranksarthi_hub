/**
 * Visible information architecture.
 *
 * This file answers ONE question: should the user know this section exists?
 * It deliberately does NOT decide whether an item is clickable — that is
 * destination availability (see src/content/destinations.ts) — and it does
 * not decide indexation, which lives on the URL record.
 *
 * A planned route can therefore be visible here, non-clickable in the UI,
 * and absent from the sitemap at the same time.
